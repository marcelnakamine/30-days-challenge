# 30 days challenge

Inspired by a video from [Matt Cutts on TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days) a long time ago.

But I adapted a little bit just to focus for 30 days in something. Can be new or just a recap of something.
And this project is just to help me stay in the rails.
